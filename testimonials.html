                strongly believe MAI is one of the amazing companies. When I am at work, I feel more at home, more
                comfortable, more in control, and more supported than I ever had before. MAI genuinely cares for your
                growth, both professionally and personally.“They treat you like a person, not an employee. That's
                reflected in the benefits and how management approaches employees, no yelling and screaming about
                challenges, just collaboration and ideas. The office environment is very fun!

                traveling for the past month with MAI and GMS, sir. This is my first job following graduation, so I'm a
                job baby to the workforce. Like everyone else, I was anxious when I first arrived here, but I also had a
                ton of hopes. There won't be any place as friendly and welcoming as this one for a newcomer. Both the
                people and the workplace are great. I'm really excited to continue my adventure here, gather a lot of
                knowledge, and build a solid foundation for my future in digital marketing. A special thanks to our dear
                GMS, sir, who has always made me feel at ease. I would also like to thank my team lead, Durga, and our
                HR department for their unwavering support. I'm very excited about the future journey.

                organisations in diverse backgrounds. Before joining MAI, I was wondering why people call their
                workplace a second home. Although I have been working here for a very short period, I have realised how
                true it is .In my observation, GMS has been an awesome guide and a mentor for everyone working here. One
                thing that
                impresses me the most is the attitude of the employees at the workplace.
                I always get to see a sense of company loyalty in most members of the team mixed with a genuine job satisfaction. Another great thing
                that I have experienced working for MAI is that a typical day is never typical, there is always
                something challenging happening and everyday is filled with new learning opportunities. On the whole,
                what I’ve learned working here is, We all can be leaders. We’re not just encouraged to lead but we’re
                empowered to do so.<span style="color: #003f6b; font-size: 25px;">❞</span>

                This emphasizes the idea that your workspace is indeed your second home, a place that instills a sense

                In MAI, I've come to believe that one person's victory is a collective win for everybody. It's a
